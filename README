This package is designed to support better logging for Go. Specifically, this
project aims to support different levels of logging and the ability to
customize log output via custom implementations of the Logger interface.

There are 3 important objects in this package.
	LogOuter: Outputs to (file, testing.T, etc)
	Logger: Decides whether on not to generate output
	LevelLogger: Easier interface for Logger.

In practice, the user is expected to use the LevelLogger as an entrypoint into
the package.

DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT IS NOT IN A SANE STATE YET. ALL EXTERNAL APIS AND
INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITH LITTLE TO NO NOTICE.
